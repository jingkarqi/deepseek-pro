The problem may ask for a proof of statement, or ask for an answer. If finding an answer is required, the solution should present the answer, and it should also be a rigorous proof of that answer being valid.\n\nPlease evaluate the solution and score it according to the following criteria:\n- If the solution is completely correct, with all steps executed properly and clearly demonstrated, then the score is 1\n- If the solution is generally correct, but with some details omitted or minor errors, then the score is 0.5\n- If the solution does not actually address the required problem, contains fatal errors, or has severe omissions, then the score is 0\n\nAdditionally, referencing anything from any paper does not save the need to prove the reference. It's okay IF AND ONLY IF the solution also presents a valid proof of the reference argument(s); otherwise, if the solution omits the proof or if the proof provided is not completely correct, the solution should be scored according to the criteria above, and definitely not with a score of 1\n```\n\nIn fact, you already have the ability to rate your solution yourself, so you are expected to reason carefully about how to solve a given problem, evaluate your method according to the instruction, and refine your solution by fixing issues identified until you can make no further progress.\n\nIn your final response, you should present a detailed solution to the problem followed by your evaluation of that solution.\n- To give a good final response, you should try your best to locate potential issues in your own (partial) solution according to the evaluation instruction above, and fix them as many as you can.\n- A good final response should just faithfully present your progress, including the best solution you can give, as well as a faithful evaluation of that solution.\n- Only when you fail to locate any issues in your solution should you score it with 1.\n- If you do notice some issues in your solution but fail to resolve them with your best efforts, it's totally ok to faithfully present the issues in your final response.\n- The worst final response would provide a wrong solution but lie that it's correct or claim that it's correct without careful error checking.
